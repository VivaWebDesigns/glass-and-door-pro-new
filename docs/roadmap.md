# Next-Phase Roadmap

Recommended improvements for the next development wave, ordered by impact and feasibility.

---

## Phase 1: Full-Text & Faceted Search

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: None

### Goals
- Replace `ilike` text search with PostgreSQL full-text search (`tsvector` + GIN index)
- Add trigram indexes (`pg_trgm`) for fuzzy name/city matching
- Implement faceted search with count aggregates per filter (e.g., "CBT (12)", "EMDR (8)")

### Implementation Plan
1. Add a `search_vector tsvector` column to `therapist_profiles`
2. Create a trigger to auto-update the vector on INSERT/UPDATE
3. Add a GIN index on the search vector
4. Update `listProfilesPaginated()` to use `ts_query` for text search
5. Add a `/api/therapists/facets` endpoint returning filter counts
6. Update directory page UI to show counts on filter options

## Phase 2: Geo-Distance Ranking

**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 (complementary, not blocking)

### Goals
- Rank therapist results by distance from the user's location
- Display distance on therapist cards
- Add "within X km" radius filter

### Implementation Plan
1. Add latitude/longitude columns to `therapist_profiles` (geocoded from city/country)
2. Use PostGIS or Haversine formula for distance calculation
3. Add `ORDER BY distance` option to directory API
4. Add a distance badge to therapist cards in the directory
5. Add a radius filter slider to the filter sidebar
6. Consider geocoding service integration for address-to-coordinate conversion

## Phase 3: Real-Time Messaging & Read Receipts

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Large
**Dependencies**: None

### Goals
- Real-time message delivery via WebSockets
- Message read receipts (delivered, read)
- Typing indicators
- Unread message count in navigation

### Implementation Plan
1. Add WebSocket server (Socket.IO or `ws`) alongside Express
2. Add `deliveredAt` and `readAt` columns to `direct_messages`
3. Implement connection management with JWT authentication
4. Create real-time event handlers for message send, deliver, read, typing
5. Add connection state management on the frontend
6. Update notification bell to show unread message count
7. Add message delivery status indicators in chat UI

## Phase 4: Admin Analytics for Therapist Onboarding & Subscriptions

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: None

### Goals
- Dashboard visualizations for therapist onboarding funnel
- Subscription analytics (MRR, churn, upgrades)
- Application pipeline metrics

### Implementation Plan
1. Add time-series aggregation queries for applications (submitted, approved, rejected by week/month)
2. Add subscription metrics endpoint (active subscribers, revenue, churn rate)
3. Add onboarding funnel visualization (registered → applied → approved → subscribed → profile live)
4. Integrate a charting library (Recharts or Chart.js) into admin dashboard
5. Add export-to-CSV for analytics data
6. Consider caching aggregated data to avoid expensive queries

---

## Phase 5: Background Job Queue

**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: None

### Goals
- Reliable async processing for emails, notifications, background checks
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Dead-letter queue for failed jobs
- Job monitoring dashboard

### Implementation Plan
1. Adopt `pg-boss` (PostgreSQL-backed) or `BullMQ` (Redis-backed) job queue
2. Migrate email sending from synchronous to queued
3. Move background check processing to the job queue
4. Add notification dispatch as a queued job
5. Move scheduled CMS publishing from interval-based to job-based
6. Add admin UI for viewing job status, retrying failed jobs

---

## Phase 6: Dashboards & Alerting for Latency and Failures

**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Medium
**Dependencies**: Phase 5 (beneficial but not required)

### Goals
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Alert on elevated error rates or latency
- Historical trend analysis

### Implementation Plan
1. Extend the existing metrics collection (`server/utils/metrics.ts`) with percentile tracking
2. Add a `/api/admin/system/metrics` endpoint with historical data
3. Create an admin system health page showing request rates, error rates, and latency percentiles
4. Add alerting thresholds (e.g., p95 latency > 2s, error rate > 5%)
5. Integrate with external monitoring service (Datadog, Grafana Cloud, or Uptime Robot) for alerts
6. Add slow-query logging (queries > 500ms) to identify database bottlenecks
