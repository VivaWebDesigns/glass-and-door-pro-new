# CMS Pages And Visual Builder

The Core Platform page builder uses structured content blocks rather than freeform page design. This keeps the site maintainable, consistent, and safer for non-technical editors.

## Builder Layout

### Structure

The left column shows the page structure and section order. Use it to jump between blocks, reorder sections, understand page composition quickly, and insert saved reusable sections.

### Canvas

The center canvas renders the actual page composition. Use it to visually confirm section spacing, images, hierarchy, and content flow.

- Block toolbars allow quick duplicate, reorder, delete, and public visibility toggles.
- Inactive blocks remain visible in the editor but disappear fully on the public site.

### Inspector

The right inspector is the primary editing surface for full block settings. It is designed for grouped editing:

- Content
- Media
- Layout
- Section Settings

The structure rail and inspector rail can both be collapsed to create more working space on smaller screens.

## Reusable Sections

Any block can be saved as a reusable section from the page builder.

- Use `Save Section` from the block toolbar or inspector.
- Saved sections appear in the sections library and can be inserted into other pages later.
- The reusable sections library is available under `Admin > CMS > Sections`.

## Previewing

- Use `Frontend Preview` from the builder toolbar to inspect the current page without builder chrome.
- Tablet and mobile preview now use real device-width frames, so they should reflect the live responsive layout much more accurately.

## Editing Best Practices

- Keep blocks focused on a single content purpose.
- Prefer page sections over trying to force unrelated content into one block.
- Use reusable dynamic blocks for content that already has its own system, such as blog previews or event previews.
- Review tablet and mobile preview before publishing large layout changes.

## Draft And Publish

- Save when you want to keep work in progress.
- Publish when the page is ready for the public site.
- Revision history remains tied to the same CMS page model, so structured content changes stay traceable.
- Use the draft preview link in the page editor when you want to review the real frontend rendering of the current saved draft before it goes live.
- Use the Quality tab before publishing to catch missing SEO fields, empty sections, incomplete CTAs, missing image alt text, and other common page issues.

## Collaborative Editing Safety

Pages now use live editor locks.

- One admin or editor can actively edit a page at a time.
- Other users may still open the page in read-only mode.
- Admins can take over a lock when needed.
- Locks refresh automatically while the editor stays open and expire after inactivity.

## Safe Content Editing Rules

- Use the rich text editor for body copy.
- Use the media library for images and documents.
- Avoid pasting raw third-party code unless the section explicitly supports HTML content.
- Check CTA links carefully before publishing.
- When sharing a preview link, remember it represents the latest saved draft. Saving again refreshes the underlying preview token so reviewers are always looking at the current version.
